        <p class="p-about">ABOUT SPLIT ROCK COFFEE</p>
        <br>
         <p class="p">Split Rock Coffee was founded with this simple idea: bring the high quality coffee usually found only in coffee houses to offices and retail customers.
                <br><br>
             Although we are a new company, our staff brings years of experience in the coffee industry.
             Our veteran coffee buyer has worked for twenty years in the specialty coffee market on behalf of
             a successful chain of coffee shops, as well as a wholesale, retail, and office coffee company. We work
            closely with a Midwest coffee importer that is a leader in the global specialty coffee industry. We follow the
            philosophy of purchasing coffees that are in season and then blending them to bring our customers the freshest beans
            available. Split Rock coffee is roasted by a Minnesota master roaster, who balances the art and science of roasting fine
            coffee that comes from over 25 years of experience. Our distribution partner is a paper and packaging supply company that
             has been serving businesses in Minnesota for over one hundred years.<br><br>

            The journey a coffee bean makes from the farm to the cup is full of small steps that must be perfectly coordinated to preserve
             the quality and flavor of the coffee. Our buyer has travelled to the countries of origin and met with coffee farmers in their
              fields, marveling at the complexity of moving coffee from remote parts of the world to market. Our coffee importer has built
              such strong relationships with growers that many deals are closed with just a handshake.<br><br>

           Choosing the highest quality beans, roasting them to perfection, and providing the best customer service possible are the foundations of
            our business strategy. We believe the difference between good and great is in the details. Split Rock Coffee delivers on our promise of quality
             from start to finish.</p><br>

    <h2>our coffee</h2><br><br>
    
   <p class="our-para">Split Rock’s coffee buyer started his career as a chef, choosing and combining flavors to create award-winning dishes. 
    Creating a great cup of coffee happens the same way. Coffees from around the world have flavor compounds that reflect the 
    soil structure and altitude at which they are grown, as well as the water supply, sunlight or shade, and other growing conditions.
     Some coffee growing regions are known for the distinct body found in the coffees they grow; other areas produce coffees with a citrus
      acidity, or in rarer cases, fruity overtones.<br><br>

    The roasting process needs to also take other qualities into account. Some coffees are soft, with a less dense cell structure, and
     are best lightly roasted, while others are hard or dense, and dark roasting brings out the flavors in the bean. Our coffee buyer
      utilizes his culinary and coffee buying experience to create blends that work best at each roast level, carefully testing them to
       be sure that the flavors are balanced in the final cup. Split Rock coffee blends are sure to please the most discriminating palate.</p><br><br>

   <p class="our-p sub-p">Light Roast</p><br>
   <p class="our-para">
      Our Light Roast is 100% Colombian from the Huila (Southern) region of Colombia. The lighter roast style is balanced, rich and brighter in
      acidity then the dark and medium roasts. This Single Origin coffee is a great example of Colombian coffee.
     </p><br><br>
    <p class="our-p sub-p">Medium Roast</p><br>
    <p class="our-para">Our Medium Roast is a traditional Breakfast Blend. This blend highlights the body of  Strictly High Grown (SHG) Central American, the mild 
        acidity of East African, and the smooth finish of the South American coffees. Medium Roast has notes of sweet chocolate with a dark cherry
         finish, and makes a great choice for Espresso.</p><br><br>

        <p class="our-p sub-p">DARK Roast</p><br>
    <p class="our-para">Our Dark Roast is reminiscent of a light French Roast.  The combination of Central American and Indonesian coffee beans produces a great 
         balance of body and acidity.  The beans naturally occurring dark cocoa, and bittersweet chocolate flavors work well with cream or milk.</p><br><br>
